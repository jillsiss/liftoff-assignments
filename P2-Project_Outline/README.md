## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here

	The application will be designed to keep track of a user's play styles in different video games. My partner and I both play a variety of video games, so we wanted to create an app where we could compare the different ways we play each one. The user will have the ability to select a video game and take a quiz that will tell them what kind of player they are for that game. The quiz could a personality quiz, similar to how BuzzFeed quizzes work, where the questions seem unrelated, but nonetheless produce a result. On the other hand, the quiz could be more straightforward, directly asking the user what their play style is. Once the quiz is submitted, the result is stored for the user, and they will be able to view all of their results on their profile page.

### Features

	User login -- users must create an account before taking any quizzes, their profile page will accumulate all results from quizzes taken
	Quizzes -- quizzes will contain multiple choice questions which will then be calculated for a result
	Remove result -- if a user doesn't like the outcome, the result can be removed from their profile
	Customize profile -- user can customize their profile page using templates to make their play style page their own

### Technologies

	C#
	MySQL
	.NET Framework

### What I'll Have to Learn

	Authentication -- for the user system to function
	Bootstrap/other CSS template editor -- add user customization
